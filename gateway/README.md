## Important Note

If you are using __2023.1, 2023.2, or 2023.3 versions of the ArcGIS Insights__, use ```insights-latest.yml``` to create a conda environment.

If you are using any of the versions __2021.2, 2021.3, 2022.1, 2022.2, or 2022.3 of the ArcGIS Insights__, use ```insights-2022.yml``` to create a conda environment.

For older versions of __ArcGIS Insights (2020.2, 2020.3 or 2021.1)__, use ```insights-base.yml``` to create a conda environment. (_Not recommended_)

The recommended channel for installing packages in conda environment is ```conda-forge```.
