## Python data scrubbing for Link Analysis

>**This example has been refactored as [horsemeatexport.py](horsemeatexport.py). The refactored [horsemeatexport.py](horsemeatexport.py) only requires the [HorsemeatSimple.csv](HorsemeatSimple.csv) file.**

This sample scubs data so that the resulting data set is ready for a link analysis within Insights.  The script creates a new data file which puts importer and exporter locations on the same row, along with other attributes explaining global trade.

* _This sample includes CSV data which needs to be placed in the same folder where the Jupyter Kernel Gateway was started._
