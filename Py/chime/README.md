# ArcGIS Insights CHIME Script

Penn Medicineâ€™s Predictive Healthcare Team adapted the susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) mathematical model, to create a new model it calls CHIME (COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics). The CHIME model provides up-to-date estimates of how many people will need to be hospitalized, and of that number how many will need ICU beds and ventilators.

The model uses a number of input parameters such as population size, percentage of infections, doubling time of the infection and, a additionally can include impacts of physical distancing measure such as stay-at-home directives.

This implementation, for ArcGIS Insights, allows for modelling of a single region, in which one value is required for these fields (column names):

_Fields / Column Names_

* Regional population
* Hospital market share (%)
* Currently hospitalized COVID-19 patients
* Doubling time in days
* Implementing physical distancing and start date is optional

This script can also be used to model multiple regions at once, for example, all counties in a state (see, cells 4 and 5).   

If you don't have ArcGIS Insights, you can download Insights Desktop [here](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-insights/resources/desktop-client-download).  
 
1. Open Insights and create a new workbook
2. Click the _Add_ button and upload the Florida shapefile
3. Rename the uploaded dataset to FloridaCHIME
4. Open the scripting console and make a Jupyter Kernel Gateway connection
5. Import _CHIME.ipynb_ into the scripting console
6. Using the data in the FloridaCHIME drag and drop fields / column names into the second cell (setting the variable named __florida_df__)
7. Once step 5 is complete, run cell 1 and 2 to completion
8. Next execute cell 3
    1. This cell uses the magic command to load the merged dataset into Insights, ie ``` %insights_return(county_run_df) ```
9. After cell 3 executes a new layer will be added to the data pane, named "Layer".  Rename _Layer_ to _Florida_.
10. Next enable location on _Florida_, by clicking the ellipse and selecting _Enable Location_.  With the enable location dialog open, select the FloridaCHIME and choose the __CountyName__ field to match. 
11. Next drag and drop CHIME data fields from the datasets in the data pane to create interactive maps, charts, and tables
