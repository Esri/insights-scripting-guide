## Snowfall analysis 

This sample comes from Esri's International Developer Summit.  The snowfalloriginal.py file is the original script used in the demo. The [snowfall.py] (snowfall.py) file is a refactoring of the original.

The scripts download 3 years of snowfall data from the web, then clean up and merge the files together.  The resulting output is a comprehensive data frame of snowfall observations, which can be brought into Insights to do further analysis.  


Data in this sample was copied from this NOAA site
